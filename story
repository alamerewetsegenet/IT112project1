The Man and The Little Cat
Once upon a time, there was a man who lived. This gentleman was not only kind, but also wise. He loved both animals and people.
He decided to go for a walk one day. The man thought, "Fresh air will help me reduce my stress." He preferred to stroll through the forest because there were few places to explore.
He was fascinated by everything until he heard an odd noise followed by a cry.The man quickly searched the area for its source. He eventually found it along the street. 
He inquired, "What is this?" He noticed a cat in a shallow hole. 
The cat tried but failed to claw its way out of the hole.
